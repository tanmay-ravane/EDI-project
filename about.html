    <h2 class="about_matter"><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
    <h3 class="about_matter"><em>The initiative of FarmEASY is created by the sole purpose of help farmers who cannot afford expensive farming equipment, Because of which efficiency of their production output does not match the growth it should have been with modern equipment.<br>Our mission is to make equipment useful for every farmer without buying it and paying huge amount for it which is a burden.
        <br>There is other side of project is as buyers who own equipment they also want to generate the income from such equipment when they are not in use for them.
        We set bridge between both parties and step ahead in the mission to boost the national farming economy</em></h3>
